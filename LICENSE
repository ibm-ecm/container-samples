The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Limited use right

With the exception of Bundled Programs, all IBM software provided to Licensee with the Program can only be used to support Licensee's use of the Principal Program under this License Information document, which means such use must be directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program.

Licensee is not authorized to use the Program to provide commercial IT services to any third party, to provide commercial hosting or timesharing, or to sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.

Multi-Product Install Image

The Program is provided as part of a multi-product install image. Licensee is authorized to install and use only the Program (and its Bundled or Supporting Programs, if any) for which a valid entitlement is obtained and may not install or use any of the other software included in the image unless Licensee has acquired separate entitlements for that other software.

Supporting Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Supporting Programs identified below only to support Licensee's use of the Principal Program under this Agreement. The phrase "to support Licensee's use" would only include those uses that are necessary or otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting Program. The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. A Supporting Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting Program's terms. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Supporting Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a VPC (Virtual Processor Core) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Supporting Program on a 10 VPC machine and another Supporting Program on a second 10 VPC machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 20 VPC entitlements to the Program.

Source Components and Sample Materials

The Program includes components in source code form ("Source Components"), or other materials identified as Sample Materials or both. Licensee may copy and modify Source Components and Sample Materials for internal use only within the limits of the license rights under this Agreement; provided, however, that Licensee may not alter or delete any copyright information or notices contained in the Source Components or Sample Materials. IBM provides the Source Components and Sample Materials without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Terms for Oracle Outside In Technology

The Programs licensed under this Agreement include Outside In filtering and document viewing technology (the "Outside In Technology") supplied by Oracle USA, Inc. ("Oracle"). The term "Outside In Technology" includes any technology licensed to Oracle by its suppliers. As used in the Agreement, the term "IBM supplier" shall be deemed to include Oracle and its suppliers. In addition to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as a condition of using the Outside In Technology, Licensee specifically agrees as follows:

(1) Oracle USA, Inc. is a third party beneficiary to this Agreement.

(2) Licensee may only transfer the Program by providing advance written notice to IBM and otherwise subject to the terms of this Agreement.

(3) Licensee may not publish the results of benchmark tests run on the Outside In Technology without prior written permission.

(4) IBM may inform IBM suppliers of compliance verification results relating to such IBM suppliers' components.

(5) To the extent allowed under applicable law, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act ("UCITA") does not apply.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Authorized User

Authorized User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Program. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers and each Authorized User may have simultaneous access to any number of instances of the Program at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person.

Concurrent User

Concurrent User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Concurrent User is a person who is accessing the Program at any particular point in time. Regardless of whether the person is simultaneously accessing the Program multiple times, the person counts only as a single Concurrent User. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers, but Licensee must obtain entitlements for the maximum number of Concurrent Users simultaneously accessing the Program. Licensee must obtain an entitlement for each simultaneous Concurrent User accessing the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means.

Processor Value Unit (PVU)

Processor Value Unit (PVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. The number of PVU entitlements required is based on the processor technology (defined within the Processor Value Unit (PVU) licensing for Distributed Software website at https://supportcontent.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-processor-value-unit-pvu-licensing-distributed-software) and the number of processors made available to the Program. IBM continues to define a processor, for the purpose of PVU-based licensing, to be each processor core on a chip. A dual-core processor chip, for example, has two processor cores.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information.

Resource Value Unit (RVU)

Resource Value Unit (RVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. RVU Proofs of Entitlement are based on the number of units of a specific resource used or managed by the Program. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements for the number of RVUs required for Licensee's environment for the specific resources as specified in the table below. RVU entitlements are specific to the Program and the type of resource and may not be exchanged, interchanged, or aggregated with RVU entitlements of another program or resource.

User Value Unit (UVU)

User Value Unit (UVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. UVU Proofs of Entitlement are based on the number and type of Users for the given Program. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements for the number of UVUs required for Licensee's environment as specified in the table below. The UVU entitlements are specific to the Program and type of user and may not be exchanged, interchanged, or aggregated with UVU entitlements of another program or type of user.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

1. User Value Unit Licensing based on Authorized Users

The Users for the purposes of UVU calculation are Authorized Users. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the entitlement to another person.

Any computing device that requests the execution of or receives for execution a set of commands, procedures, or applications from the Program or that is otherwise managed by the Program is considered a separate User of the Program and requires an entitlement as if that device were a person. 

Any Infrequent User given access to the Program requires an entitlement. An Infrequent User is an Authorized User who accesses the Program not more than one hundred twenty (120) times in any consecutive 12 month period. A single access is comprised of one or more interactions between the Infrequent User and the Program or actions performed on behalf of the Infrequent User by the Program, all within a consecutive 15 minute period. 

Licensee must track accesses by Infrequent Users to verify that they meet the access limitations of Infrequent Users. Provided such tracking mechanism exists, a ratio of ten (10) Infrequent Users will equal one (1) Authorized User for the purpose of UVU calculation. Should no such tracking mechanism exist, each Infrequent Users must be counted as one (1) Authorized User for the purpose of UVU calculation. Licensee agrees to provide to IBM and its auditors details of the tracking mechanism described above, upon request.

From 1 to 20 Users, 1.00 UVU per User
From 21 to 50 Users, 20 UVUs plus 0.83 UVUs per User above 20 
From 51 to 100 Users, 44.9 UVUs plus 0.80 UVUs per User above 50
From 101 to 250 Users, 84.9 UVUs plus 0.76 UVUs per User above 100 
From 251 to 500 Users, 198.9 UVUs plus 0.60 UVUs per User above 250 
From 501 to 1,000 Users, 348.9 UVUs plus 0.50 UVUs per User above 500

For more than 25,000 Users, 9,878.9 UVUs plus 0.33 UVUs per User above 25,000 

2. User Value Unit Licensing based on Employee Users. 

The Users for the purpose of UVU calculation are Employee Users. An Employee User is a unique person employed in Licensee's Enterprise, whether or not given access to the Program, or a unique person otherwise paid by or acting on behalf of Licensee's Enterprise who is given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Employee User is unique to that Employee User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the entitlement to another person.

Licensee must acquire sufficient UVU entitlements to cover all employees and any other unique persons paid by or acting on behalf of Licensee's Enterprise.

From 1,000 to 2,500 Users, 1.00 UVU per User
From 2,501 to 5,000 Users, 2,500 UVUs plus 0.80 UVUs per User above 2,500 
From 5,001 to 10,000 Users, 4,500 UVUs plus 0.70 UVUs per User above 5,000 
From 10,001 to 30,000 Users, 8,000 UVUs plus 0.65 UVUs per User above 10,000
From 30,001 to 50,000 Users, 21,000 UVUs plus 0.55 UVUs per User above 30,000
From 50,001 to 100,000 Users, 32,000 UVUs plus 0.50 UVUs per User above 50,000
From 100,001 to 300,000 Users, 57,000 UVUs plus 0.46 UVUs per User above 100,000
From 300,001 to 500,000 Users, 149,000 UVUs plus 0.40 UVUs per User above 300,000
From 500,001 to 1,000,000 Users, 229,000 UVUs plus 0.36 UVUs per User above 500,000
For more than 1,000,000 Users, 409,000 UVUs plus 0.32 UVUs per User above 1,000,000 

3. Resource Value Unit Licensing 

The Resource for the purpose of RVU calculation is an Eligible Participant. Each individual or entity eligible to participate in any service delivery program managed or tracked by the Program is an Eligible Participant. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to cover all Eligible Participants. 

From 1,000 to 10,000 Resources, 1.00 RVU per Resource
From 10,001 to 50,000 Resources, 10,000 RVUs plus 0.87 RVUs per Resource above 10,000
From 50,001 to100,000 Resources, 44,800 RVUs plus 0.60 RVUs per Resource above 50,000
